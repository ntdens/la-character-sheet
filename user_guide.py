                This app is designed to help make the process of creating, maintaining, and tracking
                your character as easy as possible. This guide will walk you through each of the steps in creating

                {link_create('Events')} section of the app. If you are a new player, simply record the name, date and type of
                event you are going to/just came back from, and hit the Save Events button. If you are a more seasoned player, 
                add all the events you have been to. This is important for calculating your Tier and Skill Point total.

                actually create and edit your character. It is here you should go next. Enter your character name, path, faction, professions, 
                organziations, and even upload a picture if you wish!
